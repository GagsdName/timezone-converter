## Server
To fire-up the server after cloning the repo -

* Run server/env/Scripts/activate. This will activate a virtual environment.
* Run server/app.py to start the server.
* Make sure the server launches on localhost:5000 as client expects server to launch on port 5000. (This behavior can be updated or tied to some production domain)


## Client
To fire-up the client after cloning the repo - 

* Navigate to the client directory and run 'npm install'.
* Run npm serve
* Navigate to localhost:8080 in your browser to use the app.
